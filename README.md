### About
H.A.M. is an acronym for ***H**unting **A**rmor **M**ixer*. It is also a tool to mix and match armor pieces and decorations to create custom sets in Monster Hunter World.

### How to
- Select available slots and their levels for weapon;
- Choose armor pieces;
- Insert decorations into the available slots;
- The resulting skills from your selection will update automatically;
- Name and save or get a share link for your creation;

Your saved sets can then be seen, edited or deleted anytime. The tool also has two modes: a light one and a dark one for your late night gaming sessions.
